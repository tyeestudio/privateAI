privateAI


Our mission is to simplify the process of setting up a private AI research environment. We provide pre-configured workstations with compatible hardware and software already installed, saving time and effort in finding suitable components. With our Private AI BOX, you can quickly start chatting with LLM-based AI within this streamlined research environment and focus on your AI projects without worrying about technical details.
